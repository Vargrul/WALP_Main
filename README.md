# World as A LightProbe (WALP)

This is the code for the lastest puplications of my Ph.D.
This is not in any strech production code, though it was made to run experiments with some point of automation.
The project uses two python modules, WALP_Main and WALP_ExperimentBase.

## Rough flowchart to show the use of the two main programs made for this project.
